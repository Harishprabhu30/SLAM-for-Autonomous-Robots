the problem with the ekf.yaml was path issue:

in the setup.py, we needed to add this lines to share the package. but we missed and it was the issue of odometery recieving no data.


        # ('share/jetbot_control/config', ['config/ekf.yaml']),
        (os.path.join('share', package_name, 'config'), glob('config/*.yaml')),
