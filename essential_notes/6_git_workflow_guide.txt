-- Step 1: Commit and push your current update to main

Make sure you’re currently on the main branch:

git status


If it shows you’re on main, great.
If not, switch to it:

git checkout main

Now add and commit your latest changes:

git add .
git commit -m "Update: latest working version before EKF feature"


Then push it to GitHub:

git push origin main

At this point, your main branch is up to date on GitHub with your current working code.

-- Step 2: Switch to or create your feature branch for EKF

If you’ve already created the branch remotely, fetch it and switch:

git fetch origin
git checkout feature/ekf_filter


If you haven’t created it yet, you can create and switch locally in one step:

git checkout -b feature/ekf_filter


This makes a new branch from the latest main.

Now push it to GitHub:

git push -u origin feature/ekf_filter

-- Step 3: Add your new EKF filter folder

In your project folder (e.g., jetbot_control/), create your new EKF filter module:

jetbot_control/
├── config/
│   ├── ekf.yaml 
│   ├──
│   └──


Then commit and push the feature changes:

git add .
git commit -m "Feature: Added EKF filter module"
git push

##############################################

-- Step 4: Merge later when ready

Once your EKF feature is tested and stable, merge it back into main:

git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feature/ekf_filter
git push origin main
